Road map of features to support controls

The end goal for controls is to support a higher level syntax for defining controls and bindings.

<tab pages="{items}">

</tab>


or

<list items="{items}" selectedItem="{selectedItem, mode=TwoWay}">

</list>

To get to this we have a progression of features built on top of the current set of features.

1.  Support for defining controls

    <select data-bind="{list-items:items}{list-selectedItem:selectedItem,mode:TwoWay}">

    <div data-bind="{tab-items:items}{tab-selectedItem:selectedItem}" >

2.  We may want to support controls and deal with them programatically

    <select data-control="list" >

3.  Support custom tags and attributes

    <list items="{{items}}" selectedItem="{{selectedItem, mode=TwoWay}}>

    Template: <div
                 <div
                    <div data-flow={each:$control.items}>

cockColor={templateBinding text


There appears to be a couple of options available for handing $templateParent:

1.  Allow the templateParent to be looked up as part of the applyBinding cycle, and applied.

2.  Only make a template parent available as part of applying a template, this would mean that
a tab control would actually have to have a tab.
