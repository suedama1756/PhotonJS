1.  Work out how to pull in dependencies directly from forks in GIT, e.g. for Jasmine Adapter, and pull into project
    directly. Is this what GIT sub modules are for?

2.  Need to get JSLint to work against individual files rather than the concatenated one.
3.  Need to get JSLine to be friendly with JSDoc concepts, such as type definitions.
