User Interface Library\n========================================\n\nYUI is a free, open source JavaScript and CSS framework for building richly\ninteractive web applications. YUI is provided under a BSD license and is\navailable on GitHub for forking and contribution.\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n  * [Home Page](http://yuilibrary.com/)\n  * [Documentation](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/)\n  * [Latest Production Release](http://yuilibrary.com/download/yui3/)\n  * [Forums](http://yuilibrary.com/forum/)\n  * [License](http://yuilibrary.com/license/)\n  * [Contributor Info](http://yuilibrary.com/contribute/)\n  * [Report a Bug](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/report-bugs/)\n  * [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yui/yui3.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yui/yui3)\n\n\nSource Info\n-----------\n\nThis is the active working source tree for YUI 3. It contains work in progress\ntoward the next YUI 3 release and may be unstable.\n\nWe encourage you to use the latest source for evaluation purposes, testing new\nfeatures and bug fixes, and to provide feedback on new functionality. Please\nrefer to the \"Latest Production Release\" link above if you're looking for the\nlatest stable release of YUI recommended for production use.\n\nThe YUI source tree includes the following directories:\n\n  * `build`: Built YUI source files. The built files are generated at\n    development time from the contents of the `src` directory. The build step\n    generates debug files (unminified and with full comments and logging),\n    raw files (unminified, but without debug logging), and minified files\n    (suitable for production deployment and use).\n\n  * `src` Raw unbuilt source code (JavaScript, CSS, image assets, ActionScript\n     files, etc.) for the library. Beginning with YUI 3.4.0, the `src` directory\n     also contains all module-specific documentation, tests and examples. All\n     modifications to the library and its documentation should take place in\n     this directory.\n\nThe individual component directories under the `src` directory contain Ant\nbuild files (`build.xml` and others) which can be used to build individual\nmodules using the YUI Builder. The YUI Builder is part of the \"builder\" project,\nalso available on GitHub at <https://github.com/yui/builder>\n\nThe `README` file in the `componentbuild` directory of the Builder project\ncovers the installation and use of the build tool.\n",
